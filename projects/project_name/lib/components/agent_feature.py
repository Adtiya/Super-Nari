To provide you with a complete Python agent code, I would need more specific features that your agent needs to perform. Due to the vagueness of 'agent_feature', I will assume that you want to develop a simple AI chatbot which is not multilingual but only understands English.

Here is a simple implementation of a chatbot in Python using AIML - Artificial Intelligence Markup Language:

```python
import aiml

class ChatBot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.k = aiml.Kernel()
        self.k.learn("std-startup.xml")
        self.k.respond("load aiml b")

    def get_response(self, message):
        return self.k.respond(message)

bot = ChatBot()

while True:
    message = input("Enter your message >> ")
    if message == "quit":
        exit()
    elif message == "save":
        bot.saveBrain("bot_brain.brn")
    else:
        print(bot.get_response(message))
```
Before running the script, you need to have a AIML file to define the bot behavior. 'std-startup.xml' is the initial file to load, and `load aiml b` is a command that load all AIML files in directory b.

For handling multiple languages, you would need to use a natural language processing library like Spacy or NLTK to identify the language of the input message, then write AIML files for each supported language. You could also use a translation API to convert messages to English before processing, and convert the response back to the original language. This is a complex task which needs good understanding of NLP and AI concepts.
