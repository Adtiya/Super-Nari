Your task is to assist in optimizing the global supply chain of a multinational company that produces consumer electronics. The company is facing several issues:  Logistical Optimization: The company is experiencing inefficiencies in its global supply chain, particularly in transportation and warehousing. You need to analyze the current routes and storage facilities, then propose an optimized distribution strategy, considering factors such as distance, weather, geopolitical stability, and cost.  Demand Forecasting: The company has been struggling to predict demand fluctuations for key products in various regions. Using historical data, external market trends, and AI-driven forecasting models, generate an accurate prediction for the next six months for each product category.  Sustainability: The company has committed to reducing its carbon footprint. Design a strategy that minimizes environmental impact in production, transportation, and packaging, while maintaining profitability and meeting customer demand.  Financial Impact Analysis: Evaluate the financial implications of the proposed changes, including cost reductions, potential risks, and revenue increase opportunities. Present these insights with clear projections and scenarios.  Ethical Considerations: The company is under scrutiny for its labor practices in developing countries. Suggest improvements that ensure fair wages, safe working conditions, and positive community engagement without compromising operational efficiency.  Crisis Management: Imagine a major disruption occursâ€”such as a natural disaster affecting a key factory or supply route.
