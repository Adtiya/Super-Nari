Generally, the term "sample feature" in the context of a Python agent is too wide. It could refer to many things, from sampling features from a dataset for machine learning to simply random sampling from an array of things. 

Here, I will write a small Python agent that samples 10 random features from a dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

class FeatureSampler:
    def __init__(self, dataframe):
        self.data = dataframe

    def sample_features(self, num_samples):
        # Ensuring we don't ask for more samples than we have
        if num_samples > len(self.data.columns):
            print(f"Number of samples requested ({num_samples}) exceeds number of features ({len(self.data.columns)}). Please select a smaller amount.")
            return None

        # Randomly selecting features
        random_indices = np.random.choice(len(self.data.columns), size=num_samples, replace=False)
        sampled_features = self.data.columns[random_indices]

        # Returning the sampled features
        return sampled_features

# Test
data_frame_test = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randint(0,100,size=(100, 10)), columns=list('abcdefghij'))
FS_test = FeatureSampler(data_frame_test)
sampled_features_test = FS_test.sample_features(3)

print("Sampled features: ", sampled_features_test)
```

The Python agent, `FeatureSampler`, takes a Pandas DataFrame as input and allows you to sample a specific number of random columns (features) from it. Note that it won't sample more features than existing in the dataframe, and if request exceeds, it will print a warning message.
