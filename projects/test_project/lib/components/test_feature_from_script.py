Sure! Here's a Python code that runs a hypothetical feature test script:

```python
import unittest

class FeatureTest(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        """This method is used to set up the environment for the test."""
        # Insert your setup code here

    def test_feature(self):
        """This method is used to run the feature test."""
        # Insert your feature test here

    def tearDown(self):
        """This method is called after the test method to clean up any mess left over."""
        # Insert your clean-up code here

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Your specific feature test code will be inside the `test_feature` method. This is a basic template and you will need to plug in your application specific setup, feature test, and tear down code to fully implement the test.

**How To Use:**

Run this python script from the directory it's located in the command line or terminal with the command: `python3 <python_script.py>`

NOTE: You should replace `<python_script.py>` with the name of this python file.

If the feature that is being tested passes all assertions in the `test_feature` method, you'll see an output message similar to: 

`ran 1 test in 0.000s`

`OK`

If your feature test does not pass the assertions, you'll see a FAIL message with a traceback to the failing code.

Please make sure to replace `# Insert your setup code here`, `# Insert your feature test here` and `# Insert your clean-up code here` with your own code.
