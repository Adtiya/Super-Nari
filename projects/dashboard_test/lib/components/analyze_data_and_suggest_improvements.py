Without the specific type and structure of data or the improvements you expect, it's tricky to write extact code. However, I will share generic python code which performs analysis on data. In this case, we are going to use a standard datasets library called seaborn and we will use the 'tips' dataset for this example. 

This Python agent code uses libraries like pandas for data manipulation, seaborn for data visualization and sklearn for simple linear regression model. 

Please install necessary libraries by using pip if you haven't installed it yet.

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn sklearn
```

Here is a simple Python agent code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# loading 'tips' dataset from seaborn
df = sns.load_dataset('tips')

# creating input features and target variables
X = df[['total_bill', 'size']]
y = df['tip']

# splitting data into training and testing set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# creating linear regression object
model = LinearRegression()

# training the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# comparing actual result to the predicted result
df = pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y_test, 'Predicted': y_pred})

# evaluating the algorithm
print('Mean Absolute Error:', metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred))
print('Mean Squared Error:', metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
print('Root Mean Squared Error:', np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)))

# If the value of Root Mean Squared Error is greater than 10% of the mean of the target variable,
# it indicates that our algorithm can be improved.
```

The improvement suggestions in the context of Machine Learning are:

1. Using more relevant features for prediction.
2. Choosing more suitable models, not limiting to linear regression.
3. Performing feature engineering to create new meaningful features.
4. Normalizing feature scales to enhance the model’s performance.
5. Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the machine learning model.
6. Using ensemble methods to combine predictions from multiple models.
