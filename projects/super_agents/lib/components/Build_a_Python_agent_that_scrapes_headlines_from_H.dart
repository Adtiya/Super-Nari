It seems like there's a misunderstanding. You didn't provide any code to fix. However, I can provide you with a Python script that uses BeautifulSoup to scrape headlines from Hacker News:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_hacker_news():
    url = 'https://news.ycombinator.com/'
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    headlines = soup.select('.storylink')
    for headline in headlines:
        print(headline.get_text())

scrape_hacker_news()
```

This script will print out the headlines from the front page of Hacker News. Please make sure to install the required libraries (`requests` and `beautifulsoup4`) using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

Also, please be aware of the Hacker News scraping policy. Excessive scraping may lead to your IP getting banned.
